<p> In choir we learn more than just singing. We built our physical strength through the physical trainings, we have camps and other activities</p>
<p>During the March camp recently, I stayed overnight in school with choir and i enjoyed it a lot!! THrough this camp, i got to 
  know my batchmates and seniors a lot better through th games and activities planned. I also learnt values like taking the initiative,
  teamwork and a lot more. Overall, i really enjoyed the March camp!</p>
<p>I enjoy my time in choir evem though at times it is quite hard. I hope that in the future concerts, I would be able to perform. I also
  hope to stay in soprano!</p>
